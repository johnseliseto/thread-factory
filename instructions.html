        <P>The "Thread Factory" is a game based on the classic tetris. This game is the first web development project of two crazy people who are starting to get to play with the languages: HTML CSS JS.</P>
        <p>The rules are very simple:
            When the game starts, random pieces will strat falling. Using the "left" and "right" arrow keys on your keyboard, you have to arrange the game pieces in order to meet the challenges. These challenges consist of bringing together a certain number of tiles of the same color. 
            The objective is that you always have a higher score!</p>
